Javascript is used to render 3 different random images to html to create a market survey. Image data on name, file path, number of times rendered to the page and clicks is stored in an array. When the user clicks on an image the particular images' clicked score is incremented and 3 new random images are displayed.

Day 2 Construction
Javascript was updated to generate a bar graph using Chart.js. The bar graph shows for each image, how many times it was rendered and how many times it was clicked. After 25 clicks two buttons appear giving the option to have 10 more clicks or view the results on the bar graph.

Day 3
Locals storage was utilized to store information. The results are stored until cleared by the function
